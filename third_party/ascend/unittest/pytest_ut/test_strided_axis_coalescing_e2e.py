"""Native gate-on regression for ``StridedAxisCoalescing``.

This intentionally uses the original T2L eligibility shape instead of forcing
an option in the test: a one-dimensional block pointer has ``stride=S`` and a
base of ``ptr + (pid % S)``; ``pid // S`` selects the T tile.  The default NPU
compile mode is ``unstructured_in_simt``, which supplies the historical
``force_simt_template`` half of the T2L gate on a real 910_95/A5 target.

Do not run this test on a generic/B4 machine.  Pretending that such a machine
is 910_95 would exercise a different compiler/toolchain contract and would not
validate this pass's original gate.
